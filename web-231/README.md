## Course Description

Learn JavaScript by writing JavaScript.  This course covers the concepts of programming using JavaScript in the Enterprise.  Focus is on the JavaScript
programming language syntax, software design, coding, documenting, and debugging strategies.  Topics include Data Types, Reference Types, Operators, Objects,
Control Statements, and Functions.  Projects use these topics in an intensive, hands-on format to build enterprise relevant solutions.  GitHub is used to
host and share coding projects.

Prerequisite: WEB 200

## Repository Overview

Carefully read the assigned chapters, videos, and narrative I've included under each exercise and assignment.

Most exercises and assignments have runnable sample code so you can visually see the concept "in action."  Assignments are broken into "milestones" and each "milestone" builds on the last.

Approach every week from top-to-bottom and do not move to the next assignment/exercise without fully understanding the previous.
